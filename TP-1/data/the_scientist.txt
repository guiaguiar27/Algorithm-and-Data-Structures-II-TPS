come up to meet you
tell you im sorry
you dont know how lovely you are
i had to find you
tell you i need you
tell you i set you apart
tell me your secrets
and ask me your questions
oh lets go back to the start
running in circles coming up tails
heads on a science apart
nobody said it was easy
its such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be this hard
oh take me back to the start
i was just guessing at numbers and figures
pulling your puzzles apart
questions of science science and progress
do not speak as loud as my heart
tell me you love me
come back and haunt me
oh and I rush to the start
running in circles chasing our tails
coming back as we are
nobody said it was easy
oh its such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be so hard
im going back to the start
